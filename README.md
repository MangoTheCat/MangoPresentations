## FAQs

### Are you guaranteed to come present?
We will do our best to say yes to all requests, but sometimes we may have to say no if consultant availability is low or it would cost us too much to support the consultant's attendance. 

### Where will you present?
As a guideline, any user groups outside the UK will have us presenting via webinar. We will consider conferences outside the UK if they are relevant to our business.

### Who will come to deliver the session?
Each of the sessions has one or more experts on the topic - you can check out the details of who is likely to present by checking out the session abstract. Once we receive a request, we'll work with you to confirm all the important logistics including who will be coming along.

### What if I want something not on the list?
If you'd like us to come present something specific, still get in touch but please give us plenty of notice to ensure we have time to put something together for you.

### I see an abstract but it isn't on the list above?
This means we're currently working on the presentation, check back later or let us know that you're interested in it anyway.
