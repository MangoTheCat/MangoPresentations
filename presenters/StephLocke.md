Short Bio
------
Steph Locke (@SteffLocke) is a Principal Consultant at Mango Solutions and does a lot of cool stuff, from building snazzy Azure 6NF data warehouses to developing R web services. On top of the cool day job, she organises user groups & SQLRelay, speaks at events, and runs a boardgame company.

Long community bio
------
Steph Locke wants to live in a world where everyone she encounters enjoys their jobs and is awesome. Since she's gifted with the inability to be daunted by a task, she's using her unbounded perkiness to bring awesomeness to the people.

In the day job of Principal Consultant at Mango Solutions, she roves the countryside helping people use a blend of open source and proprietary technologies to make better decisions, which hopefully means more money!

When she?s not making numbers look pretty, you can probably find her at a community event. 

If it's not an event she's organised, then she's at someone else's event where they've been crazy enough to let her talk or help out at. EARL, SQLBits, SQL Relay and SQL Saturday organisers have all let Steph speak and help out, and most recently she was nominated for the Tribal Award recognising her gift of the gab and willingness to help out. 

She runs three user groups in Cardiff and supports a number of others. As well as enjoying helping increase awesomeness locally, she's also tackling the task nationally! A veteran organiser of SQL Relay, Steph runs the Cardiff event growing it year on year, and has taken stints running the marketing, sponsorship and the whole conference to help bring more knowledge to the masses.

Her latest project ? run 1, speak 1 ? has her running an event and speaking at a different one each month for the whole year. If you want to attend one of her user groups in Cardiff, or get her to a user group or conference near you this year, contact her (@SteffLocke) on twitter to find out more.

Long professional bio (WIP)
------
Starting off in "the business" and falling sideways into "IT", Steph has worked in insurance and finance for most of her professional career delivering new and valuable insight to companies. She's now working a Principal Consultant at Mango Solutions to help bring value to more companies around the UK, and internationally.

With a number of analytics, reporting, and data warehouse solutions under her belt she knows her Microsoft and open source technology stacks. 

Technical skill, and a business focus, are complemented by strong mentoring and management skills. Having mentored staff over the past three years and having lead a growing team, Steph can help deliver not only a better "technical solution" but a better "people solution".

Having worked in primarily smaller organisations, Steph has learnt to interact with everyone from front-line staff to CxOs and has sat on various steering groups that help blend turn strategy into tactics.
