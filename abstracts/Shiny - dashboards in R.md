Shiny: dashboards in R

Short description
------
Need a snazzy dashboarding tool, and want it free or cheap?
With a modicum of R and Linux knowledge, you can make interactive realtime dashboards for free that can be used in any web browser. Learn how in this session.

Medium description
------
R, the open source stats and data analysis language, has a new(ish) reporting engine called Shiny. It's a free tool that allows for realtime, interactive dashboards with a minimum of fuss. This session takes you through the key functionality, development practices and infrastructure required to implement it.

Full description

Conventional wisdom for project management is that you can have two out of three: fast, cheap, and good. This session presents a great tool that allows you to have all three. The only gotcha is this - you need a Linux box and you have to use some open source software called R!

This session takes you through the steps needed to build and deploy Shiny applications to a Linux environment. We will be looking at how you make a dashboard, what infrastructure you need to host one, and how you do deployments from source control!
