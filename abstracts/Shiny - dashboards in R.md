Conventional wisdom for project management is that you can have two out of three: fast, cheap, and good. This session presents a great tool that allows you to have all three. The only gotcha is this - you need a Linux box and you have to use some open source software called R!

This session takes you through the steps needed to build and deploy Shiny applications to a Linux environment. We will be looking at how you make a dashboard, what infrastructure you need to host one, and how you do deployments from source control!
